THE INFORMATION REVOLUTION
From 1991 until now.

An era marked by the spread of telecommunications technology, especially with personal computers, the internet, the web-based economy, social media, smart phones, and greater cross-cultural mixing. Late-stage capitalism as inequalities increased. The rise of China. Death cults terrorize the world early in this era, and extremism poses a threat to global security. The threat of global conflict remains as leadership in North Korea, China, and Russia use outdated paradigms to justify policies that prepare their nations for military conflict with neighbors (Ukraine, Georgia, Taiwan). Anti-democratic nationalist tendencies manifest in the United States (Trump), Brazil, Hungary, Poland, Turkey, the Philippines, China, Russia, Egypt, and elsewhere. But popular people’s movements for the environment, peace, and democracy (e.g., the Arab Spring, anti-global-warming activism, Black Lives Matter, Occupy Wall Street, Anti-Iraq-War) also manifest, and win some victories. Anthropocene global climate catastrophe threatens humanity. Mass extinctions begin.
